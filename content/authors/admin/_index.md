The Wyoming Kernza Project seeks to investigate the role that perennial grains could serve in revitalizing Wyoming wheat agriculture. This reseaarch effort is funded by Western SARE, and run by Jay Norton at the University of Wyoming

We are investigating the role that Kernza Intermediate Wheatgrass can play in improving soil health and nutrient and water useage as an economically viable crop in Eastern Wyoming dryland wheat agriculture. The experiment is currently set to run from Spring 2021 through Spring 2024.
