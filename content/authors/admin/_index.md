The Wyoming Kernza Project investigates how perennial grains could revitalize Wyoming wheat agriculture. This research effort is funded by Western SARE, and run by Jay Norton, Hannah Rodgers, and Alex Fox at the University of Wyoming.

We want to answer the questions "Can KernzaÂ® intermediate wheatgrass be a profitable and sustainable grain crop in eastern Wyoming?" and 
"What can soil health and water use research tell us about how Kernza can be resiliant under climate change?"

This represents our plan as of Fall 2020, and some things have changed since then!
