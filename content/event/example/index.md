Though the project is only in its first year, we expect to find results similar to previous 
research, which show that Kernzaâ€™s deep perennial roots sequesters carbon and curtails soil 
erosion. Kernza has been shown to support a microbial community more similar to soils of native 
prairie than to those of annual wheat, contributing to soil aggregation, enhanced microbial carbon 
stabilization, and tight nutrient cycling. We also hope to find soil microbial properties that 
correlate with improving soil health in this ecosystem, such as fungi:bacteria ratio, enzyme 
activities, or microbial biomass. We predict that despite lower yields, higher market prices and 
soil health benefits will make Kernza a viable option for High Plains wheat farmers. Overall, 
Kernza holds promise for agricultural production in sensitive areas, and can contribute to an 
agricultural system resilient in the face of climate change."
