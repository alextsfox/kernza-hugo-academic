Thanks to Sarah Derouin for writing this article about our project! We have now done 4 interviews about Kernza 
in Wyoming, and it’s honestly thrilling to have so much interest in our little graduate research project. 
We’re feeling grateful to the journalists who share our story, to everyone driving this huge interest in 
perennial grains, and of course to the farmers (who are the real researchers here).
