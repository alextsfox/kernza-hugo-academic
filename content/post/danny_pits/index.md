Soil color can tell us a lot about what going on down there 
(black for organic matter, red & yellow for iron, white for 
calcium carbonateâ€¦) We dug pits for a research project looking 
at high-elevation hay meadows and thought about how deep-rooted 
perennial grasses (like Kernza ðŸŒ¾!) can energize soil formation 
and organic matter storage in these prairie soils
