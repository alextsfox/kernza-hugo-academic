We went to Kansas for the Land Instituteâ€™s early career workshop! 
We got to tour the Kanza Prairie and learn how disturbance (bison, fire) 
affects plant communities and meet to many people studying so many aspects of perennials- water and nutrients use, climate impacts, 
genetics, soil organic matter formation, supply chains, intercropping, disease resistanceâ€¦ ðŸŒ¾ðŸ¥³

Hannah and I both gave short talks at the conference -- check them out here
