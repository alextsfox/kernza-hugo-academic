Here’s Alex describing how Eddy Covariance systems can measure carbon sequestration in ecosystems!** This setup is monitoring the effects of pine beetles and fire in the Snowy Range, but the same system will measure carbon and water cycling in Kernza.

Some notes: this doesn’t actually measure the total water budget if an ecosystem, just the gaseous component. Also, the net carbon assimilated by an ecosystem in a given year isn’t necessarily permanently sequestered.
