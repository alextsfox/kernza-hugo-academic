We made a soil cake for the FAO Soil Cake Contest! 
Any guess what kind of soil it might be? 
And can you spot some kernza on top? 
(Really hoping we win some t-shirts 🤞) 
Update: Yes it’s a mollisol, thanks for the guesses! 
Mollisols are prairie soils, and ones formed in semiarid places often have a calcium carbonate build-up just below the root zone, 
which is the whitish powdered-sugar layer at the bottom😁
