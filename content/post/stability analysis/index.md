Got to use this crazy contraption last week!

Most of the soil breaks apart and falls through the 
sieves when it’s dunked in water, but stronger soil 
aggregates hold together and stay on top, which lets 
us measure “Soil Aggregate Stability.” Healthier soils 
tend to aggregate more, which prevents them from eroding 
away in a big rain or windstorm, and provides great habitat 
for soil life
