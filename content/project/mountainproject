This is my long-term ongoing project to sift through ~~all~~ a large portion of mountainproject data. It's sort of my data science
pet project. I work on it pretty sporadically, and don't really have a definite goal for it. 

Here's what I've done, and what I want to do in the future:

1. **Scrape Mountain Project** for user and climb data (not listed on github; I'm not sure if mountainproject would appreciate a tool gather and disseminate most of their users' information). 
Mountainproject has a limited API that lets someone download a *specific* user's information, probably for individual use, but it can be adapted to download larger amount of data.
I've done this by writing a script to crawl each US state's "classic climbs" page and downloading user tick data (ie. climbs they have done) for everyone who ticks or rates any of those climbs. 
When I initially did this, it was in a house with crappy internet and that would shut off every ~5 hours or so, so it took several days to actually get all the information I wanted. In the end,
I wound up with about ~200,000 datapoints to mess around with. Now that I live somewhere with better internet I could probably do better, but since December 2020 Mountain Project's new owners, OnX, have stopped honoring API requests. Maybe something will change in the future though. 

2. **Organize and filter the data** to get make it actually readable. This was also a bit of a nightmare. 
It turns out that the [yosemite decimal system](https://www.mountainproject.com/international-climbing-grades) difficult to understand for both humans and machines. 
When downloading the data, I probably should have found a way to request *Ewbanks* rating data, but hindsight is 20/20 I suppose. 
Another issue is that most people don't really select *how* they climbed a certain route: Did you faall? Did you do it on your first try? Was it on toprope? This is a single pitch climb, yet you claim to have climbed 6 pitches of it. How am I supposed to interpret that?
Perhaps I shouldn't be so annoyed. After all, I'm not sure if any of these people consented to have strangers analyze their climbing data. 
(For the record though, I did my best to anonymize the data, and when I do get around to publishing something substantial on it, it won't include any information that could be used to identify anyone.)
Finding ways to distinguish all of this noise will be challanging, since limiting my dataset to only people who log their climbs how *I* want them to severely limits what I can use (<1% of the data) and injects a lot of selection bias as well.

3. Do something interesting. I've made some rudimentary analyses that I think are fun, like comparing people's maximum sent grades to their median sent grade (turns out that most people can climb *way* harder than they usually try to), but
the holy grail for me would be do rank climbing areas from "most" to "least" sandbagged --  ie. what places shut down otherwise strong climbers, and where can almost anyone hop on a 5.12? (though it's probably just going to be Vedauwoo and the Red River Gorge). 
I'll try to post updates on that as I come to it. 

So that's what to expect from this project blog (from time to time). Hopefully I can put some sort of dent in this project again this year.
